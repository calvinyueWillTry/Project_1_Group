## HTML
Mainpage: We start with the head, and then the links that we are using for everything, from fonts to CSS. At the top of the page, we added links to the Battle and Pokemon selection pages (the pokeball).

Then there's the title in the header, along with links in the navigation bar, as well as the audio in an autoplay loop. We also added the links to the API links that we used for this project as "resources and credits."
