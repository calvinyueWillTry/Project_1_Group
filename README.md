Pokemon Selection Page: We start with the title in the header, and that's followed by having the "pokemon-list" and "pok-img" to get the Pokemon pictures from the API (in the JS). Then the list of hard-coded spots for allowing the Pokemon to appear on the page are below.

Every spot for the Pokemon is also hard-coded with an element for the <div> section,  A place on the page for the image, name and description. Because it's an array, the array is also hard-coded, albeit from 1-20 instead of 0-19. 
At the footer, There are buttons to either navigate to the battle page, or return to the homepage.
